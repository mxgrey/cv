\cvevent{Volunteer Instructor}{\href{https://www.saturdaykids.com/social-mission/code-in-the-community/}{Code in the Community}}{May 2019 -- November 2020}{}
Code in the Community was a program that provided free coding lessons to children of disadvantaged families in Singapore. As instructor, my role was to prepare educational presentations, explain programming concepts to the class, lead the students through hands-on exercises, provide students with one-on-one help to supplement the efforts of the assistants, and mentor the teaching assistants to maximize their ability to help the students.
